## In flight

### Block B PR 5 — Message counter integration

- **Branch**: `claude/block-b-pr5-message-counter`
- **PR**: [#27](https://github.com/Juli2admin/mindreset/pull/27)
- **Status**: Open, owner-approved, **NOT merged**.
  Blocked on Vercel production deploys (see SESSION_HANDOFF.md).

Adds `consumeMessage(userId)` to `lib/billing/limits.ts` and wires
billing gate + post-stream increment into `app/api/minimind/chat/route.ts`.

### Block B PR 6 — Top-up purchase flow

Likely already covered by PR 3's webhook handler
(`checkout.session.completed` → `topUpMessagesRemaining += 200` via
idempotent `Purchase` row). **Re-scope before starting** — may be a
no-op PR.

## Known launch blockers (not in Block B)

These need attention before public launch but are out of Block B scope:

- **Vercel production deploys** — currently broken; auto-deploy on
  `main` not firing. See `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
- **`mindreset.ai` DNS** — domain not yet connected to Vercel.
- **`User.screeningResult` is never populated** — screening row
  linkage works, but the denormalised result field on User is left
  null. Tracked in `docs/carry-forward.md`.
- **Welcome email + AI support email Pattern A** — Resend installed
  but not wired. Both are launch-critical.
- **Clerk production instance setup** — currently dev keys. Production
  instance needs setup. Tracked in `docs/carry-forward.md`.
- **Auth-page translation** — sign-in / sign-up / terms / privacy are
  EN-only.
- ~~`/account` language toggle restoration~~ — ✅ resolved by TopBar
  integration; `LanguagePicker` renders on every TopBar-using surface
  (`/home`, `/pricing`, `/minimind`, legal pages).
- **RU phrases in safety scanner** — Phase 3c keyword scanner is
  EN-only.
- **Pre-launch native translation pass** for fr/de/es/it/pl/pt — use
  `translate-missing.mjs`.
- **T&C duplication in signup flow** — pre-existing on main, needs
  investigation.

## External (Block F — Julia's steps)

- UK Limited company registration
- ICO data-controller registration
- Solicitor review of T&Cs and Privacy
- Domain DNS final setup (mindreset.ai → Vercel)
- Designer pass on Landing / Account
- Stripe Tax UK confirm OFF (done — Julia confirmed not VAT-registered)

## Carry-forward themes

These have come up repeatedly across sessions and are worth keeping in
mind. Full notes in `docs/carry-forward.md`:

- `Conversation` orders by `startedAt`, not last-activity — known
- v2.3 type-to-practice categories run ahead of the named-practice
  catalog — known
- Orphan DB columns from abandoned preferredName work — to be cleaned
- WellbeingSnapshot updates are async — race between update and read
  not addressed
- Tier downgrade edge case: subscriber cancels → inherits high
  `lifetimeMessagesUsed` → instantly at-cap on free fallback. Flagged
  in PR #27 audit, deferred.

## Roadmap v1 status

`docs/roadmap/MindReset_Roadmap_v1.md` dated 15 May 2026 is the
strategic document. It is significantly out of date in places
(pricing, especially) and should be refreshed once Block B ships. The
v1 numbers in the roadmap supersede nothing — `tiers-and-pricing.md`
and `decisions/locked-decisions.md` are the current sources of truth.
